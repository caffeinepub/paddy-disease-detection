  "summary": "The diff implements all six requirements (REQ-12 through REQ-17). The backend Disease type and all five disease entries include the new fields (fertilizers, preventionTips, seasonalAdvice, severityLevel, yieldImpact, quickActions). The frontend DiseaseResult component renders Fertilizer Recommendations, Prevention Tips, Seasonal Advisory, Severity Badge with Yield Impact, and Quick Actions sections. A migration module is also added. All requirements appear to be met with no clear gaps or hallucinated features beyond the migration module.",
